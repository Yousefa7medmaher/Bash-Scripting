![Bash Scripting Banner](bashImg.jpg)


Welcome to my Bash scripting repo! Here I share real-world scripts I use for Linux system administration, automation, backups, networking, and DevOps tasks.

## 📂 About

These scripts reflect my hands-on experience with **RHEL 9** during my journey to become a DevOps engineer. They are practical, reusable, and tested in real scenarios.

## 🚀 Use Cases

- 🔁 Automation & scheduling  
- 🔐 User & permission management  
- 🗃️ Backup & restore (`rsync`, `tar`)  
- 🕵️ Log & system monitoring  
- 🌐 Networking & SSH tasks  
- 📦 Package and service management

Stay tuned — more scripts coming soon!
